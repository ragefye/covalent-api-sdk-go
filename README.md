# My Covalent SDK Exploration 🚀

Fork of: covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go  
Goal: test core API endpoints (balances, NFTs, tx history) from mobile and publish POA.  
Status: ✅ Forked (07/09/2025) — Next: run first balances query.# Covalent SDK for Golang

The Covalent SDK is the fastest way to integrate the Covalent Unified API for working with blockchain data. The SDK works with all [supported chains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/) including Mainnets and Testnets. 

**Note - Require `go1.22.1` and above for best results.**

> **Sign up for an API Key**
>
> To get your own Covalent API key, **[sign up here](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/auth/register/)** and create your key from the *API Keys* tab.

## Getting started

```
go get github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go
```

## How to use the Covalent SDK

After installing, you can import and use the SDK with:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/covalentclient"
    "github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/chains"
)

func main() {
    var Client = covalentclient.CovalentClient("API_KEY")
    resp, err := Client.BalanceService.GetTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(chains.EthMainnet, "demo.eth")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("error: %s", err)
	} else {
		if len(resp.Data.Items) != 0 {
            // get first Balance
            fmt.Println(*resp.Data.Items[0].Balance)
		}
	}
}
```
> **Name Resolution**
>
> The Covalent SDK natively supports ENS domains (e.g. `demo.eth`), Lens Handles (e.g. `@demo.lens`) and Unstoppable Domains (e.g. `demo.x`) which automatically resolve to the underlying user address (e.g. `0xfC43f5F9dd45258b3AFf31Bdbe6561D97e8B71de`)

### How to apply supported query parameters to endpoints
Query parameters are handled using variables that are `references and pointers`. Developers can reference the `godocs` for autocomplete suggestions for the supported parameters. These supported parameters can be passed in any order. 

For example, the following sets the `QuoteCurrency` query parameter to `CAD` and the parameter `Nft` to `true` for fetching all the token balances, including NFTs, for a wallet address:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/covalentclient"
    "github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/services"
    "github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/quotes"
    "github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/chains"
)

func main() {
    nft := true
	var quoteValue quotes.Quote = quotes.CAD
    var Client = covalentclient.CovalentClient("API_KEY")
    resp, err := Client.BalanceService.GetTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(chains.EthMainnet, "demo.eth", services.GetTokenBalancesForWalletAddressQueryParamOpts{Nft: &nft, QuoteCurrency: &quoteValue})
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("error: %s", err)
	} else {
		if len(resp.Data.Items) != 0 {
            // get first Balance
            fmt.Println(*resp.Data.Items[0].Balance)
		}
	}
}
```

The functions `GetAllTransactionsForAddressByPage()`, `GetTransactionsForAddressV3()`, and `GetTimeBucketTransactionsForAddress()` have been enhanced with the introduction of `Next()` and `Prev()` support functions. These functions facilitate a smoother transition for developers navigating through our links object, which includes `Prev` and `Next` fields. Instead of requiring developers to manually extract values from these fields and create Golang API calls for the URL values, the new `Next()` and `Prev()` functions provide a streamlined approach, allowing developers to simulate this behavior more efficiently.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/chains"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/covalentclient"
)

func main() {
	debug := true

	var Client = covalentclient.CovalentClient("API_KEY", covalentclient.CovalentClientSettings{Debug: &debug})
	resp, err := Client.TransactionService.GetAllTransactionsForAddressByPage(chains.EthMainnet, "demo.eth")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("error: %s", err)
	} else {
		if len(resp.Data.Items) != 0 {
			// get first Balance
			fmt.Println(*resp.Data.Items[0].BlockHash)
			prev, er := resp.Data.Prev()
			if er != nil {
				fmt.Printf("error: %s", err)
			} else {
				fmt.Println(prev.Data.CurrentPage)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Additional Helper Functions
### CalculatePrettyBalance
The `CalculatePrettyBalance` function is designed to take up to 4 inputs: the `Balance` field obtained from the `TokenBalances` endpoint and the `ContractDecimals`. The function also includes two optional fields, `roundOff` and `precision`, to allow developers to round the unscaled balance to a certain decimal precision. The primary purpose of this function is to convert the scaled token balance (the balance parameter) into its unscaled, human-readable form. The scaled balance needs to be divided by 10^(contractDecimals) to remove the scaling factor.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/covalentclient"
    "github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/chains"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/valuefmt"
)

func main() {
    var Client = covalentclient.CovalentClient("API_KEY")
    resp, err := Client.BalanceService.GetTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(chains.EthMainnet, "demo.eth")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("error: %s", err)
	} else {
		if len(resp.Data.Items) != 0 {
            // get first Balance
			prettybalance := valuefmt.CalculatePrettyBalance(*resp.Data.Items[0].Balance, *resp.Data.Items[0].ContractDecimals, true, 0)
			fmt.Println(prettybalance)
		}
	}
}
```
### PrettifyCurrency
The `PrettifyCurrency` function refines the presentation of a monetary value, accepting a numerical amount and a fiat currency code as parameters (with USD as the default currency). It simplifies currency formatting for developers, ensuring visually polished representations of financial information in user interfaces for an enhanced user experience.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/chains"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/covalentclient"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/quotes"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/valuefmt"
)

func main() {
    var Client = covalentclient.CovalentClient("API_KEY")
    resp, err := Client.BalanceService.GetTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(chains.EthMainnet, "demo.eth")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("error: %s", err)
	} else {
		if len(resp.Data.Items) != 0 {
            // get first Balance
			opts := valuefmt.NewCurrencyOptions();
			opts.Currency = quotes.CAD
			opts.Decimals = 5			
			prettyCurrency := valuefmt.PrettifyCurrency(*resp.Data.Items[0].QuoteRate, opts)
			fmt.Println(prettyCurrency)
		}
	}
}
```

## Built-in SDK Features
### Explaining Pagination Mechanism Within the SDK

The following endpoints support pagination:

- `GetErc20TransfersForWalletAddress()`
- `GetTokenHoldersV2ForTokenAddress()`
- `GetBlockHeights()`
- `GetLogEventsByAddress()`
- `GetLogEventsByTopicHash()`
- `GetChainCollections()`
- `GetTokenIdsForContractWithMetadata()`
- `GetAllTransactionsForAddress()`

Using the Covalent API, paginated supported endpoints return only 100 items, such as transactions or log events, per page. However, the Covalent SDK leverages go channels to *seamlessly fetch all items without the user having to deal with pagination*. 

For example, the following fetches ALL transactions for `demo.eth` on Ethereum:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/chains"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/covalentclient"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
	results := make(chan services.TransactionResult)
	go func() {
		var Client = covalentclient.CovalentClient("API_KEY")
		// Call the function and pass parameters
		resultChan := Client.TransactionService.GetAllTransactionsForAddress(chains.EthMainnet, "demo.eth")

		// Receive values from the result channel
		for result := range resultChan {
			// Process each result as it becomes available
			results <- result
		}

		// Close the results channel when done
		close(results)
	}()
	// Now you can read values from the results channel as they arrive
	for result := range results {
		// Process each result
		if result.Err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("error: %s", result.Err)
		} else {
			fmt.Println(*result.Transaction.BlockHeight)
		}
	}
}
```

### Debugger Mode

Developers have the option to enable a debugger mode that provides response times, the URLs of called endpoints, and the HTTP statuses of those endpoints. This feature helps users identify which endpoints may have encountered failures. The default is `debug = false` if no input is provided.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/chains"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/covalentclient"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/quotes"
	"github.com/covalenthq/covalent-api-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
	nft := true
	var quoteValue quotes.Quote = quotes.CAD
	debug := true

	var Client = covalentclient.CovalentClient("API_KEY", covalentclient.CovalentClientSettings{Debug: &debug})
	resp, err := Client.BalanceService.GetTokenBalancesForWalletAddress(chains.EthMainnet, "demo.eth",
		services.GetTokenBalancesForWalletAddressQueryParamOpts{Nft: &nft, QuoteCurrency: &quoteValue})
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("error: %s", err)
	} else {
		if len(resp.Data.Items) != 0 {
			// get first Balance
			fmt.Println(*resp.Data.Items[0].ContractName)
		}
	}
}
```

### Retry Mechanism

Each endpoint is equipped with an exponential backoff algorithm that exponentially extends the wait time between retries, up to a `maximum of 5` retry attempts.


### Error Handling
The paginated endpoints throw an error message in this format: `An error occurred {ErrorCode}: {ErrorMessage}`. The developer will need to `catch` these errors. Note - these endpoints do not follow the default response format which is:
```go
❴ 
    "Data": ...,
    "Error": false,
    "ErrorMessage": nil,
    "ErrorCode": nil
❵
```

### Error codes
Covalent uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Covalent's servers (these are rare).

| Code      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 200      | OK	Everything worked as expected.       |
| 400   | Bad Request	The request could not be accepted, usually due to a missing required parameter.        |
| 401   | Unauthorized	No valid API key was provided.        |
| 404   | Not Found	The request path does not exist.        |
| 429   | Too Many Requests	You are being rate-limited. Please see the rate limiting section for more information.        |
| 500, 502, 503   | Server Errors	Something went wrong on Covalent's servers. These are rare.        |

## Tests
Before running tests, go to the `testutil/test_util.go` file and update your `API_KEY`. Do not commit this into your branch. Now you can run your tests in the root directory.
```
go test ./tests/
```
OR

you can run individual tests for each service, for example
```
go test ./tests/security_service_test.go
```

## Documentation

The Covalent API SDK documentation is integrated within the source code through `godoc` comments. When utilizing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the SDK provides generated types and accompanying documentation for seamless reference and usage.
